Introduction to Random Strings

Given: A DNA string s of length at most 100 bp and an array A containing at most 20 numbers between 0 and 1.
Return: An array B having the same length as A in which B[k] represents the common logarithm of the probability that a random string constructed with the GC-content found in A[k] will match s exactly.
