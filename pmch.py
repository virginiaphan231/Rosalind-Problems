Perfect Matchings and RNA Secondary Structures
url: http://rosalind.info/problems/pmch/

Given: An RNA string s of length at most 80 bp having the same number of occurrences of 'A' as 'U' and the same number of occurrences of 'C' as 'G'.
Return: The total possible number of perfect matchings of basepair edges in the bonding graph of s.
